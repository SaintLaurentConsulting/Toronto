Question: What is the best way to maitain the POWER BI Dashboard versions?

For example. I have 1 Dashboard published on Power BI. Viewed by the CEO of the company everyday. 
There is a new analyst joined the company. The task is to make minor change of the Power BI dashboard. 

As the new analyst, what is the best way to make the change of the dashboard, but minimize the risk of screwing up the version that CEO is viewing?
